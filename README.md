# Overview

Welcome to  <img src='images/CTRL-ALT-DEFEAT-SMALL.png' width=10% height=10% />     GitHub Machine Learning project page. 

This is our final team project for the <a href="https://bootcamp.unc.edu/data/">**UNC Chapel Hill Data Analytics Course**</a> 

## GitHub Application
<a href="https://jillibus.github.io/Vehicle-Identification">Vehicle Identification</a>

## Communication Protocols

**Team Name:** <img src='images/CTRL-ALT-DEFEAT-SMALL.png' width=10% height=10% />  

**Team Members:**  

> <a href="https://github.com/hsp910"> Harsh Patel </a>  
> <a href="https://github.com/jillibus"> Jill Hughes </a>  
> <a href="https://github.com/ltmurphy"> Logan Murphy	</a>  
> <a href="https://github.com/CrossCreed"> Mihai Anghel	</a>  

> The team will regularly use **Slack** for communicating updates and sharing of links/files.   
> The team will meet twice a week, after class, and once more during the weekend for final updates.   
> Any project emergency communication will be via phone.   

## Selected Project Topic

**Vehicle Image Recognition**

## Business Applications for Vehicle Image Recognition

> The topic at hand was selected for its potential use in intelligent transportation applications that focus on monitoring of traffic flow, automated parking systems, and security enforcement.  Adding physical characteristics, with existing systems that track traffic patterns that include type, velocity, direction and position, (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks - VANETs), would advance the information provided for use in additional applications.

> Our first project Goal is to create a Image Recognition Model, using the simplest form of the model, that will recognize whether or not a vehicle is present in a photo from our data set. 

> Once we achieve our first Goal, we will add to this model, and determine whether or not the vehicle in the image is a BMW or another brand of vehicle.

> Future Goals of this project, with added complexity and continued development, is to determine the make and model of targeted vehicles. 

> The final iteration will have a multidude of potential real world uses such as amber alert and law enforcement application integration. 

## Source Data Chosen

* Data Sources: charity_data.csv
* Software: Google Colabority, Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7, Pandas

## **Questions the team hopes to answer with the data:**


---
## GOAL 1: Create a Image Recognition Model, using the simplest form of the model, that will recognize whether or not a vehicle is present in a photo from our data set. 

### Description of the data exploration phase of the project:


### Description of the analysis phase of the project:

### Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project:
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
> Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. 
> Further analysis will be completed using Python.

#### Database Storage
> Postgresql is the database we intend to use hosted on Amazon Web Services, AWS.  
> We will be using AWS R3 storge for the images. 
> We will integrate Flask to display the data.

#### Machine Learning
> SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier to determine if an image has a vehicle or not, or what type of vehicle it has.
> TensorFlow will be the application and libarary where we will be using and testing the Neural Networks Models.
> Our training and testing setup is ___. 

### Dashboard
> In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. 
> We will also look at Tableau Dashboard to determine if that will work with our application.
> It will be hosted on Amazon Web Services, AWS.
