# Vehicle-Identification
## Overview

Welcome to **Ctrl Alt Defeat's** GitHub Machine Learning project page. 

This is our final team project for the **UNC Chapel Hill Data Analytics Course**. (feel free to edit/suggest/remove this section as you see fit)

### **Communication Protocols**

**Team Name:** Ctrl Alt Defeat

| `Team Members`|

The team will regularly use **Slack** for update communiations and sharing of links/files. 

We will meet twice a week after class and once more during the weekend for final updates. 

Any project emergency communication will be via phone.

### **Selected Topic**

Vehicle Image Recognition

### **Reason**

> The topic at hand was selected for its potential use in certain applications. 

> Using image recogition, the simplest form of the model will recognize whether or not a vehicle is present in an photo from our data set. 

> With added complexity and continued development, the aim of this project is to determine the make and model of targeted vehicles. The final iteration will have a multidude of potential real world uses such as amber alert and law enforcement application integration.

### **Recommendation for future analysis:**

### **Anything the team would have done differently:**


### **Communication Protocols:**
There is a team Slack for regular updates. We meet twice a week after class and once more for final updates.
Emergency contact will be by phone, numbers shared in Slack.


### Technologies Used
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

#### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

#### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

#### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on AWS.
