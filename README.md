# Overview

Welcome to ![teamlogo](CTRL-ALT-DEFEAT-SMALL.png)'s GitHub Machine Learning project page. 

This is our final team project for the <a href="https://bootcamp.unc.edu/data/">**UNC Chapel Hill Data Analytics Course**</a> 

## GitHub Application
<a href="https://jillibus.github.io/Vehicle-Identification">Vehicle Identification</a>

## Selected Project Topic

**Vehicle Image Recognition**

## Business Applications for Vehicle Image Recognition

> The topic at hand was selected for its potential use in intelligent transportation applications that focus on monitoring of traffic flow, automated parking systems, and security enforcement.  Adding physical characteristics, with existing systems that track traffic patterns that include type, velocity, direction and position, (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks - VANETs), would advance the information provided for use in additional applications.

> Our first project Goal is to create a Image Recognition Model, using the simplest form of the model, that will recognize whether or not a vehicle is present in a photo from our data set. 

> Once we achieve our first Goal, we will add to this model, and determine whether or not the vehicle in the image is a BMW or another brand of vehicle.

> Future Goals of this project, with added complexity and continued development, is to determine the make and model of targeted vehicles. 

> The final iteration will have a multidude of potential real world uses such as amber alert and law enforcement application integration.

### Technologies Used
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

#### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

#### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

#### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on AWS.
